Teensyterpreter

A small C-based script for the Teensy to be compiled with the Arduino IDE. The primary function of this script is to open a reverse TCP shell between the victim and attacker in a short amount of time.

Note: You will need to change line 151 in the script to reflect your own information, i.e. your public IP address and any port of your choice (the port you choose MUST be the same one that you configure Metasploit to listen on and the same one you forward on your router). I'll make it more user friendly soon™.
